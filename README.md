## Usage
Analyze and design structural components and systems with the modules in this package.   

## Status
The current offerings are pretty niche, with a focus on thin-walled structures.  There is plenty of potential for growth with Julia's numerical firepower at hand though, especially for large system problems.  This is just the beginning.

## Primitives

[PlautBeam](https://github.com/runtosolve/StructuresKit.jl/blob/master/docs/PlautBeam/PlautBeam.md)
Perform second order structural analysis of single or multi-span thin-walled beams with a uniform loading.  

## Helpers

[InternalForces](https://github.com/runtosolve/StructuresKit.jl/blob/master/docs/InternalForces/InternalForces.md)
Calculate internal axial force, shear, moment, and torsion from a structural member's displaced shape.
