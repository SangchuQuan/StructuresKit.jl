# StructuresKit

Analyze and design structural systems.


## Package Features

- Perform analysis of structural systems under static or dynamic loads.
- Assemble large systems from primitives (beams, columns, shells, connections).
- Consider geometric nonlinearity in the solution.
- Include material-specific constitutive behavior.
- Calculate internal forces and moments from deformation fields.
- Visualize deformation in 3D.
- Utilize codes and standards libaries to create design workflows.
- Write your own design applications.
